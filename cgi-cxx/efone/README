1. What is this?

This is a distributed telephony system for Linux. The goal is to have a
distributed system similar to ICQ where clients connect to each other using
the location information provided by central server(s).

2. What is the current state of the project?

The basic client/server that can connect another one of it's kind over the
net and send & receive voice in full duplex mode without compression is
ready althouth it does contain a lot of bugs probably. It's usable only on
LANs or on high bandwith WANs at the moment because of the lack of
compression.

3. What is the roadmap?

- clean up and debug client
- add compression algorightms (gsm and others)
- create central server that keeps user's data with a web based interface
- add gtk or qt interface
- debug, debug, debug

4. How can i help?

You can join the development by sending patches to the author (me). Any help
would be apreciated.

5. Contact info:

The project's home page is: http://www.elysium.pl/members/brush/efone/  .
You can also reach my via e-mail at: brush@elysium.pl

6. Hardware requirements.

You will need a full duplex sound card with oss compatible sound driver to
use this application. I use Soundblaster AWE 32 for my development.

7. How to build/use it?

Unpack the distribution. Change to the resulting directory. Type 'make'.
After a short while everything should finish and you have the resulting
'efone' binary. Run it on 2 machines and issue a "connect <destination ip>"
command. It should connect and you can speak.
Use the 'help' command to learn more.
