    * include/csptr/{smart_ptr.h,apply.h}: Removed the destructor helper macro
    * include/csptr/{smart_ptr.h,smalloc.h}: Changed the vararg usage to
    struct vararg. This change is **NOT** backward-compatible. Parenthesis
    around the value were removed with this change, and metadata is no longer
    passed as two separate parameters.

    * include/csptr/smart_ptr.h: Smart pointers now take a mandatory value.
    * doc/csptr.3: Fixed some typos and updated to latest interface.

    * configure.ac: Removed --with-malloc-wrapper ./configure flag.
    * src/wrap_malloc.{c,h}: Removed malloc/free wrappers.
    * check/*: Added unit tests & coverage reports.
    * mman.c: Fix for shared pointers accessing the wrong metadata.

    * configure.ac: Added --with-malloc-wrapper and --with-fixed-allocator
    flags for ./configure.

    * src/mman.c: Added a fixed allocator support -- if the user does not
    want to override at runtime the allocators used by smalloc/sfree and just
    want to use malloc and free, they may enable this option using the
    --with-fixed-allocator configuration flag.

    * src/wrap_malloc.{c,h}, src/mman.c: Added malloc/free wrappers.
    Pointers produced by malloc can be used with the `smart` attribute,
    and smart pointers may be passed to free. This option is deactivated
    by default, and can be enabled using the --with-malloc-wrapper
    configuration flag.

    * src/smart_ptr.h: unique_ptr and shared_ptr now take a type parameter
    instead of a size.

    * src/smart_ptr.h: Added support for static array types in the unique_ptr
    and shared_ptr macros.

    * src/mman.{c,h}: Added smart array allocation through smalloc. smalloc
    has been changed to take a mandatory `nmemb` parameter, that may be 0
    if the allocated type is a scalar, and an array for any other value.

2015-01-13  Franklin "Snaipe" Mathieu  <franklinmathieu@gmail.com>

    * src/smart_ptr.h: Added unique_ptr and shared_ptr macros, added
    `smart` variable attribute.

    * src/mman.{c,h}: Added smalloc, sfree, sref, and get_smart_user_meta.
    Alternative allocators may be specified by setting the contents of
    `smalloc_allocator`.
