CHANGELOG - Nmail

0.1.76
	* Apparently the META expires tag is not enough to keep some proxy
	  servers from caching pages. Added a HTTP header to resolve this.
	* Changed cgi parsing entirely. Some browsers would send other, 
	  unexpected headers with forms that were post/multipart.
	* Fixed problem where some browsers would send form data for 
	  post/multipart in different order than the input fields were 
	  actually listed

0.1.75
	* Added MIME-Version header field which fixed some clients that
	  expected it for MIME attachments
	* Changed it so Reply-To header reflected user so bounced messages
	  would come back properly
	* Fixed problem where incorrectly configured sendmail would cause
	  messages trying to be sent to return error, even though sent properly
	* Fixed problem that resulted from Netscape for linux not sending
	  Content-Type with multipart form attachments
	* Added more verbose error descriptions
	* Fixed few minor bugs

0.1.74
	* Added support for RFC2047 (non-ascii characters encoded in 
	  header file). This not only fixed display problems, but also
	  problems resulting from the filenames of attachments being encoded
	  in this format.
	* Fixed problem with filenames that had spaces
	* Fixed problem where ending boundary was sent with text MIME 
	  attachments

0.1.73
	* Fixed errors that could occur if Content-Disposition header
	  entry came before other entries that required parameters
	* Fixed spelling of Original when reply/forward message

0.1.72
	* Changed crypt library. Now compiles on distros:
	  Redhat-6.x, Mandrake-7.0, SuSE-6.3, Slackware-7.0, Caldera-2.3
	* Fixed date/time display on message view

0.1.71
	* Fixed problem with reply to addresses that are in address book not
	  appearing in compose message form

0.1.70
	* Initial public release

0.1.xx
	* Many development versions

0.1.01
	* Initial development version - April 3, 2000
