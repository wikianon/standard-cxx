In the libs/darwin/ppc and lib/darwin/x86 directories, there are libraries
that are covered under the GPL. These libraries are

  libintl
  libstdc++
  libgcc_s.

In strict terms, we are in violation of the GPL by not shipping the source
code along with the libraries. We capitulate. These libraries are available
to MacOS users, but instead of causing users to traverse untold machinations,
we decided to just ship the binaries for the libraries.

If you would like the source code for these libraries (we will leave versions
up to you), you can find them at

  libintl -> http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
  libstdc++ -> http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/
  libgcc_s -> http://gcc.gnu.org/

We'll be honest with you. We'll get away with this as long as possible. But
if the all-powerful FSF sword is waved under our noses, we will ship the
source code. It just seems like a huge waste of bandwidth to deliver the
entire source code for GCC just to comply with the GPL.
