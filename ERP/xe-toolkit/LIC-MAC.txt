INTRODUCTION

Licensing of The XE Toolkit (XE)

INSTALLATION OF THE XE TOOLKIT INDICATES
ACCEPTANCE OF THE LICENSE TERMS.

BE SURE TO READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.
IT EXPLAINS THE DUAL LICENSING OF THE XE TOOLKIT.

YOU MUST READ AND AGREE TO ONE OF THE TWO LICENSES
CONTAINED IN THIS PACKAGE.

XE is licensed under two licenses: the GNU General Public License (GPL) and a commercial license.  This file explains the principle of dual licensing, and what obligations are implied by using the GPL version of XE.

Please note that it is necessary to choose either the Open Source or Commercial license at the outset of development. Captive Metrics' commercial license terms do not allow you to start developing proprietary software using the Open Source edition.

The text of the individual licenses is in the following files:

GPL:        LICENSE-GPL.txt
COMMERCIAL: LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.txt

Be sure to read whichever license applies to your installation.

ABOUT DUAL LICENSING
====================

Dual Licensing is based on the principle of Quid Pro Quo - something for something. If you, your company or your organization derive commercial benefit from Captive Metrics' products and do not wish to release your complete source code, you are required to purchase the appropriate number of commercial licenses.

Alternatively, if you are willing to follow the terms of the GPL (General Public License), Captive Metrics software is available to you under Open Source licenses which allow you to develop, modify and distribute your software freely. If you wish to use an open source version of Captive Metrics' products, you must contribute all your source code to the open source community, according to the terms of the applicable open source license.

By offering both open source and commercial licenses, Captive Metrics ensures the availability of resources for ongoing development and improvement of XE. By purchasing commercial licenses, you are no longer obligated to publish your source code.

COMMERCIAL AND OPEN SOURCE LICENSES
===================================

Captive Metrics' Commercial licenses allow customers to develop, use and distribute their applications under standard commercial terms.

Captive Metrics' Open Source versions are available under the terms of the GPL - General Public License. The main obligation for software development under the GPL is that anyone using your XE-based software must have access to the complete source code, and must be able to modify and redistribute that software to anyone free of charge.
