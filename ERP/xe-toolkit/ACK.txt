We at Captive Metrics would like to acknowledge the following people and
organizations for their contributions to our software. The whole is a sum
of its parts and these parts made a real difference.

*) Karsten Lentzsch, the JGoodies guy at http://www.jgoodies.com. Karsten,
   thank you so much for your work. It makes Java look so much more
   professional.

*) Jason J. Simas, the author of the Chart2D library. His stuff can be found at
   http://chart2d.sourceforge.net/. Jason, we hope you decide to do Chart3D.

(We know that both Karsten and Jason would like a little remuneration for
 their considerable work, so as soon as we have income coming in, we'll send
 a little your way. You deserve it.)

*) I don't see any damn manifolds. Just a tree.

*) Jeff Skaletsky, the ubiquitous uber-guru of Unix system administration.
   Jeff, again and again, thank you.

*) The geniuses at Trolltech who were kind enough to let us use their licenses
   for our own software since it was exactly what we wanted. Thank you so much,
   especially, Cathrine Bore.

*) Especially, the biggest thank you to Mrs. Richard Pettit who allowed her
   husband to follow his dream and start Captive Metrics Software Corporation.
   You, too, are a visionary.
